Aleterated
==========

This is a mini-game done for class in the 2nd year of the Grade. The game is in spanish, and it is for Windows Phone 7, written using XNA. I'm sorry that I do not have a release or executable version of this one, but you can still view the code.

Description
-----------

This is a game for mobile phones, intended to play in portrait mode. In this game, you have to complete a word selecting the letters one by one (which are mixed) while they move in circle in a limit of time. Each time you complete a word you gain a little more of time. When a certain number of words are completed, the level is increased (and a longer word will appear).

The words are loaded from a XML file, so a designer could easily edit them. If you leave the application in the middle of a match, the game is saved, so the next time you open it you can continue.


Notes
-----

This game is made by Rubén Negredo and Héctor Antón.
